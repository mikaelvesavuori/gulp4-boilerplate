# Gulp 4 Boilerplate

## Current version
Version: 0.1 (20170429)

## Author
[Mikael Vesavuori](http://www.mikaelvesavuori.se), 2017

## Still very unstable
This is currently not stable yet. It attempts to do most of what the [Gulp 3 Boilerplate](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/gulp3-boilerplate) does, but due to differences between version 3.0 and 4.0, I am not quite there yet.

## What does the boilerplate provide?
- [Gulp 4](http://gulpjs.com) which is the still unreleased new version of today's de facto standard frontend build platform
- [Browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io) which runs a local webserver, which is then live-reloaded through Gulp's watch tasks
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) (with [PreCSS](https://github.com/jonathantneal/precss) and [cssnext](http://cssnext.io)) so you can run super-sweet CSS whether you feel the traditional preprocessor love or you'd rather want futuristic not-yet-seen wizardry
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io) which compiles your JS ES2015 code to ES5 which will run on pretty much any browser these days
